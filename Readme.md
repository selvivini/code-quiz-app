### App Decription
For this homework Assignment created a quiz app using html,css and Javscript.
Used webApis and Dom manipulation for creating the html elemnts dynamically during the 
runtime of the application.Used css for styling and written media queries to make the 
app look good on various widthports.

### App functionality
This app opens up with the start quiz page,
Once the user clicks the start quiz app button, the quiz starts with a series of questions with multiple
choices, and the timer starts with 75 seconds.If the user click the correct answer choice the score increases with 1 point and for every wrong answer the time left gets reduced by 5 seconds as a penalty. If the user cannot complete the quiz within the time left, the quiz ends and timeup screen showsup. The score depends on how fast the user finishes the quiz.The overal score sums up the score with the timeleft.Then the user can submit the initials and it takes to the highscore page.Here we can find the history of quiz taken with the initials submitted.
